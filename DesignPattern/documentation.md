# Design Patterns
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code.

## Benefits of patterns

Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. 
Even if you never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches 
you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.

Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more efficiently. 
You can say, “Oh, just use a Singleton for that,” and everyone will understand the idea behind your suggestion. 
No need to explain what a singleton is if you know the pattern and its name.

## Classification

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed. 

The most basic and low-level patterns are often called idioms. They usually apply only to a single programming language.

The most universal and high-level patterns are architectural patterns. 
Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. 
Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.

In addition, all patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose.

**Creational** patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

**Structural** patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

**Behavioral** patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

**2. Command Pattern**
**3. Observer Pattern**
